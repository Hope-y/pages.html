<p>From Vox articels here some qoutes
<blockquote>
Compared to dogs, scientists have found, cats don't seem to have the same sort of emotional attachment to their owners, and show genuine affection far less often than you might think.
Further, they're an environmental disaster, killing literally billions of birds in the US every year â€” many of them from endangered species.</blockquote>
