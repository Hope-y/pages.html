<blockquote>
You will never eat alone again!  Thereâ€™s nothing like having a dog in your face while you are trying to eat dinner at night. 
If they can get close enough (like if you are eating on the couch) you may even be lucky enough to get a little dog drool on your plate. 
Or if you have a brave dog, they will just take a bite without you even offering.  It happens.</blockquote>
