<blockquote>With mischievous eyes and sweet faces, ferrets are undeniably adorable. They are a small size and can provide your family with a sweet long-term pet...
They will entertain you endlessly with their antics and will happily play with ferret toys. Watching ferrets play for the sheer joy of it is guaranteed to lift your mood...
Ferrets can be trained to go in a box, though not to the same extent as cats and there are bound to be a few accidents. Most ferrets can be fairly reliably trained to use a litter box in and out of their cages. </blockquote>
